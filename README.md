# OpenGL Game Engine
This is very much still in-dev and should not be used as components will be changed and deprecated.<br>
This is a 2D game engine made from scratch. It is built on a custom implementation of Entity Component System (ECS).

Features:
- ECS Architecture, enabling more memory and performance efficient game objects
- Sprite and 3D model rendering, using OpenGL
- Spritesheet based animation system
- Audio, using OpenAL
- 3D model loading, using Assimp
- Tilemap loading, using Tiled
- Physics and collision system

Futures:
- Networking, using Enet
- 3D physics and collision system
- 3D camera
- Scene saving and component serialization
- UI system
- Text rendering
- Comprehensive documentation
