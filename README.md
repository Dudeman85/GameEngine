# OpenGL Game Engine
This is very much still in-dev and should not be used as components will be changed and deprecated.<br>
This is a 2D game engine made from scratch. It is built on a custom implementation of [Entity Component System (ECS)](doc/ECS%20Technical%20Documentation.docx).

Getting started guide: [here](doc/Class%20References/Getting%20started.md)

Features:
- [ECS Architecture](doc/Class%20References/ECS%20Reference.md), enabling more memory and performance efficient game objects
- [Sprite](doc/Class%20References/Sprite%20Reference.md) and 3D model rendering, using OpenGL
- Spritesheet based animation system
- [Audio](doc/Class%20References/Audio%20Reference.md), using OpenAL
- 3D model loading, using Assimp
- [Tilemap](doc/Class%20References/Tiled%20Reference.md) loading, using Tiled
- [Physics and collision](doc/Class%20References/Physics%20Reference.md) system

Futures:
- Networking, using Enet
- 3D physics and collision system
- 3D camera
- Scene saving and component serialization
- UI system
- Text rendering
- Comprehensive documentation
